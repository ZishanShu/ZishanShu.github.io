## Research & Projects

### Cryo-EM Electron Density Map Guided High-Precision Atomic Model Reconstruction
- Utilized the EMDB Cryo-EM dataset and corresponding PDB protein structures, applied Diffusion for Cryo-EM re-atom segmentation, and aligned the 3D structure using the Viterbi algorithm and Hidden Markov Process.

### Complex Dynamics Equilibrium Distributions Prediction
- Used MD dataset (MDVerse) and DIG module, combined with RoseTTAFold for protein dynamics conformational distribution prediction.
