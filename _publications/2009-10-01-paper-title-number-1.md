excerpt: 'Achieving accurate forecasts of passenger car sales can help car companies set reasonable sales targets. However, the existing forecast models are plagued by the following problems. First, the models do not take into account the impact of the importance of features on the forecast ability. Secondly, single feature data cannot reflect the complex buying and selling logic of the passenger car market, and the previous models have not been able to explore the combination effects between different features well. Therefore, in this work, we propose a passenger car sales forecast model based on the convolutional neural network and attention mechanism (PCSFCA). Its innovation lies firstly in the use of the attention mechanism to calculate the importance of features, which enables the model to value important features and ignore unimportant ones. The second is the use of convolutional neural networks to extract the higher-order information of features, which facilitates the model to capture complex data distribution. Besides, we use the 5G network to build a cloud platform for real-time collection of passenger car sales records. The collected sales data are input to the model, and then the model can be learned in real-time. The comparison of experimental results with several benchmark models illustrates the effectiveness of the PCSFCA model.'

title: "MTPNet: Multi-Grained Target Perception for Unified Activity Cliff Prediction"
collection: publications
category: oral
permalink: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10260243
excerpt: 'Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug
discovery and material design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding targets, which restricts the applicability of these
prediction models. In this paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS) guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multigrained protein semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs, helping to accelerate compound optimization and design.
